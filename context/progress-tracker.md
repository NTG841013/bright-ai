# Progress Tracker

Update this file whenever the current phase, active feature, or implementation state changes.

## Current Phase

- Phase 1: Foundation

## Current Goal

- Define the immediate implementation goal here.

## Completed

- Design system (01-design-system.md): shadcn/ui components (Button, Card, Dialog, Input, Tabs, Textarea, ScrollArea, Tooltip), lucide-react, lib/utils.ts cn() helper, globals.css dark theme variables — all installed and build verified.

## In Progress

- None yet.

## Next Up

- Add the next planned feature unit here.

## Open Questions

- Add unresolved product or implementation questions here.

## Architecture Decisions

- Add decisions that affect the system design or data model.

## Session Notes

- shadcn uses base-nova style variant with base-ui primitives (not radix).
- Tailwind v4 @theme inline used to map CSS vars to utility color tokens.
- lib/utils.ts cn() uses clsx + tailwind-merge (both already in dependencies).
